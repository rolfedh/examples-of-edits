Technical writing and AI: a tale of tractors, fields, and fresh manure

## Introduction
If life was a movie, I'd be at the post-catalyst moment where the hero stares at themselves in the mirror and debates whether they can and must face the difficult quest ahead. But this isn't Hollywood, so I'll save you the dramatic pause and tell you what I'm telling myself: **_It will be just fine. Trust me on this._**

I’ve been musing on the future of technical writing, a noble profession standing at the crossroads of a transformative technological era. Let me paint you a picture — maybe it hits home, maybe it’s a bit offbeat, or maybe it teaches a different lesson than I intended. Regardless, here it is:

## Main Body*
Visualize a remote village nestled between verdant hills and lush farmland. As its inhabitants, we work tirelessly on the land, our lives governed by the ebb and flow of the seasons. We’ve heard rumors of miraculous machines, “tractors,” they call them, yet none of us have seen one up close until now.

Our neighbor returns from a trip to the city, steering this monstrous contraption, its gears grinding, pulling an impressive array of farming tools behind it. Our hearts thud in our chests — both from exhilaration and a twinge of panic. Just like that, we are in the presence of a revolution.

**Facing the AI Revolution**
This is precisely where we find ourselves as technical writers today. AI is our metaphorical tractor, promising to amplify the fruits of our labor. The natural response, tinged with a scarcity mindset, might be: Oh dear, do we need fewer farmers/writers now? But, as with many panic-induced thoughts, this isn’t entirely accurate.

**Why AI is Not a Threat But an Opportunity**
For starters, even without the advent of AI, has anyone managed to document everything needing documentation? Not even close. From maintaining and updating a mammoth backlog of content to addressing undocumented features and tailoring content to a diverse user base — there’s more work than we can handle.

Moreover, the advent of AI in docs coincides with its arrival in coding software. The tech industry isn’t sitting idle while AI takes strides. And more software means even more to document. Think of it as job security, if you will.

Lastly, while AI might ease the manual aspect of writing, the cognitive functions remain firmly in human hands. Rather than wielding a hoe, we now get to master the tractor while also strategizing on crop rotation and harvest planning. Translation? You’ll focus on the nuanced art of designing, researching, editing, verifying, and validating content.

While this simplistic analogy and dash of optimism set the stage, the script has many more scenes to unfold. Just as the mechanization of farming saw the younger generation venturing into new fields (pun intended), the technical writing profession will also experience shifts.

Folklore and history are rich with tales of young people leaving familiar homesteads to pursue different careers. Some of us might leave, while others join us, riding the wave of demand and remuneration.

**Enhancing Your Skills in the AI Era**
Whether you are a newer or established professional, consider investing further in your craft:

- Deepen Product Knowledge: Take courses, read books, roll up your sleeves, and get down to the nitty-gritty of the product.

- Know Your Users: Understanding your users’ needs is a formidable superpower in this AI-driven era. Sharpen your listening skills.

- Human Relations: Working with your software engineering team is an art. Master it, and you’ll see both personal and professional growth.

- Specialization: Besides enhancing your general skills, delve into a niche area. This knowledge not only shields you from potential displacement but makes you invaluable.

This transformative period for technical writing isn’t the end; it’s just a fresh chapter. Let’s welcome it with open arms, shall we? It’s here anyway, just like that neighbor and their damn tractor ;-)
