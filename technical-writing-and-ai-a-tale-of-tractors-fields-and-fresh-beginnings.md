Technical writing and AI: a tale of tractors, fields, and fresh manure

Imagine life as a movie. We're at that pivotal scene where the hero, gazing at their reflection, grapples with the decision to embark on a challenging quest. However, life is no Hollywood production, so let's bypass the suspense. Here's what I tell myself, and what I'll tell you: **_It will be just fine. Trust me on this._**

My musings have recently turned towards the future of technical writing — a distinguished field now at the precipice of a technological renaissance. Allow me to illustrate this by creating a unique mental image. Whether this metaphor resonates, feels slightly quirky, or elicits a different interpretation, I believe it's worth sharing:

Picture a secluded village, snuggled amid verdant hills and thriving farmlands. As villagers, our lives are intricately woven into the rhythm of the seasons as we labor on the fertile earth. We've heard whispers of a magical machine, the "tractor," but until now, none of us has witnessed its prowess firsthand.

Imagine our anticipation as a fellow villager returns from the city, commandeering a hulking machine that grinds and grumbles while hauling an array of impressive farming equipment. Our hearts flutter with a potent mix of excitement and apprehension. Suddenly, we're at the dawn of a revolution.

In much the same way, this mirrors the current state of us technical writers. AI represents our symbolic tractor, pledging to exponentially enhance our productivity. An instinctual reaction, steeped in fear of scarcity, might be: Oh dear, does this mean we need fewer farmers—or writers? But, like most panic-driven thoughts, this notion lacks nuance.

Even before AI's introduction, could we confidently say we've documented all that requires documentation? Far from it. Our tasks span from managing and updating an ever-growing backlog of content, addressing uncharted features, to tailoring information for a multifaceted user base. There’s more work than we can possibly tackle.

Additionally, the AI integration in documentation coincides with its increasing presence in coding software. The tech industry isn't sitting on its laurels as AI progresses. The growth in software creation equates to a surge in documentation. This, in a way, offers job security.

And importantly, while AI might alleviate the manual aspect of writing, the cognitive aspects remain under our jurisdiction. Now, instead of using a hoe, we'll be learning to operate the tractor, strategizing about crop rotation and harvest planning. The real-world translation? You’ll be focusing more on the complex art of designing, researching, editing, verifying, and validating content.

While this humble analogy and my sprinkling of optimism help lay the groundwork, remember that our script is far from finished. Similar to how farming's mechanization nudged the younger generation towards unexplored territories (pun indeed intended), the profession of technical writing is on the brink of transformative shifts.

History and folklore abound with tales of youngsters leaving the comfort of their homes to carve out different career paths. The same could happen here. Some of us might exit, while others enter the profession, lured by increased demand and compensation.

Whether you're a novice or seasoned professional, consider investing further in your craft:

- Deepen Product Knowledge: Immerse yourself in courses, literature, and hands-on experience to truly understand your product.

- Know Your Users: Comprehending your users’ needs is a superpower in this AI-centric era. Hone your empathy and listening skills.

- Human Relations: Building relationships with your software engineering team is an art. Perfect it for personal and professional benefits.

- Specialization: Along with enhancing your overall skills, delve into a niche area. This specialized knowledge not only safeguards you from potential displacement but elevates your value.

This transformative period in technical writing isn't a conclusion; it’s merely a fresh chapter. So, let's welcome it with open arms, shall we? After all, it’s here regardless, much like that neighbor with their intriguing new tractor ;-)
