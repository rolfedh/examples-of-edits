Technical Writing and AI: A Story of Tractors, Fields, and New Possibilities

Picture life like a movie. We're at the part where the main character has to decide if they're brave enough to go on a challenging adventure. But real life isn't a movie, so let's get to the point: **_Everything is going to be fine. Trust me._**

Lately, I've been thinking about what's coming next for technical writing. This important job is at a turning point because of new technology. To help you understand what I mean, let's think about it like this:

Imagine a small village surrounded by green hills and farmland. As villagers, we work hard on the land, following the changing seasons. We've heard about a powerful machine, a "tractor," but we've never seen one until now.

Now, picture our excitement when one of our neighbors comes back from the city driving this massive machine. It makes loud noises and pulls a bunch of farming tools. Our hearts beat fast from the thrill and a little bit of fear. Just like that, everything changes.

That's kind of like what's happening to technical writers now. AI, our tractor, promises to make our work easier and more productive. You might worry and think: Do we need fewer writers now? But that's not entirely right.

First, even before AI, there was so much work to do that nobody could finish it all. There's always something to write about, from managing a big backlog of content to talking about new features and adapting content for different users. We have more than enough work to do.

Secondly, AI is not just changing how we write. It's also changing how people code software. And more software means there's even more to write about. In a way, it's like job security.

Lastly, while AI can help with the actual writing, we still have to do the thinking. Instead of using simple tools, we'll be operating complex machines and planning how to do our work. What does that mean? You’ll be focusing more on designing, researching, editing, checking, and confirming content.

While this simple story and a little optimism help to set the scene, there's more to come. Just like when farming started using machines, the younger generation started exploring new jobs. Technical writing will change too.

Young people often leave home to find different careers. The same could happen here. Some of us might leave while others join, drawn by the demand and pay for the job.

Whether you're new or experienced, consider doing more to improve:

- Learn More About the Product: Take classes, read books, and get hands-on experience with the product.
  
- Understand Your Users: Knowing what your users need is a superpower in this AI-era. Improve your listening skills.

- Work Well With Others: Getting along with your software engineering team is important. Get good at it, and you'll see personal and professional growth.

- Specialize: As well as improving your general skills, get really good at one area. This knowledge will protect your job and make you more valuable.

This change in technical writing isn't the end; it's just a new chapter. Let's embrace it, shall we? It's here anyway, just like that neighbor with their new tractor ;-)
